I's definately a lot easier
 to find the differences between versions using a tool
  instead of just by looking at it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
 make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

 I shall have to wait and see.

 What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

 Pros: I do it on a need-to basis. 
 Cons: I might not commit at the right times.
